<p>Learn Python regular expressions by writing the following 3 functions.</p>
<p>In each function's <code>docstring</code> we show the expected result.</p>
<p>The tests verify these expected results when you hit <em>Save + Verify</em>. We will do a more ample regex bite later on.</p>
<p><em>Note that for parsing HTML you would use a library of some sort, this is just to train your regex skills.</em></p>
<p><strong>Update 14th of Aug 2019</strong>: we updated the template slightly (text inputs are passed into the functions) to improve the tests for this Bite. If you get confusing result, use <em>Try again</em> to start with the updated template.</p>
